## 🔍 Project Overview

This web app takes user input for stock market values and returns a predicted closing price. It uses a trained machine learning model (`model.pkl`) built during learning exercises and serves predictions through a Flask web server.

### 🧠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Python, Flask
- **Model Training:** scikit-learn
- **Deployment Ready:** Yes (Localhost)
